## Original Documentation

## Project/Process Overview
This document outlines a multi-agent system designed to streamline the creation and publication of workflow diagrams. The system's primary goal is to assist users in efficiently documenting various types of processes by generating a structured Markdown description and a corresponding flowchart image, which are then merged into a comprehensive document and posted to a specified GitHub repository. The `interactive_process_creator_agent` orchestrates the entire process, leveraging specialized sub-agents to handle documentation, diagramming, merging, and publishing tasks.

## Structure and Key Components
The core of this system is the `interactive_process_creator_agent`, which acts as the central orchestrator, managing user interactions and delegating tasks to a team of specialized sub-agents.

### Specialized Roles and Units

#### interactive_process_creator_agent
*   **Core Function:** Serves as the central orchestrator and user interface for the entire system.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Receives initial workflow diagram creation requests from the user, including a short description of the process structure and goals.
    *   Delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents (e.g., `process_documentation_architect`, `diagramer_agent`, `wrapper_agent`, `posting_agent`).
    *   Presents the final integrated document (Markdown + PNG) to the user for feedback and approval.
    *   Prompts the user for the target GitHub directory upon approval.
    *   Manages the overall workflow and ensures seamless execution across agents.
*   **Decision Points:** Decides which sub-agent to delegate to based on the current stage of the workflow; determines when to present the final document to the user and await approval.

#### process_documentation_architect
*   **Core Function:** Specialized in generating structured Markdown descriptions of workflow diagrams.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Receives a user's short process draft from the `interactive_process_creator_agent`.
    *   Utilizes the `google_search` tool to research and define specialized terms, technical standards, or common organizational best practices related to the described process.
    *   Employs the `robust_writing_agent` (consisting of `process_writing_agent` and `ProcessValidatorChecker`) to draft, refine, and validate the process description in Markdown format.
*   **Decision Points:** Determines when the Markdown description is complete and validated according to the process structure and goals.

##### robust_writing_agent
*   **Core Function:** Ensures high-quality and validated process documentation.
*   **Sub-agents:**
    *   **process_writing_agent:** Drafts the initial Markdown content based on the input and research.
    *   **ProcessValidatorChecker (Loop agent):** Validates the drafted Markdown description against requirements, ensuring accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the specified structure. It can request revisions from the `process_writing_agent` until validation criteria are met.

#### diagramer_agent
*   **Core Function:** Converts the Markdown workflow description into a visual flowchart diagram (PNG format).
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Receives the Markdown file generated by the `process_documentation_architect`.
    *   Utilizes the `google_search` tool for any necessary diagramming standards, tools, or best practices.
    *   Employs the `robust_diagramer_agent` (consisting of a `diagramer_agent` and `ProcessValidatorChecker`) to create and validate the flowchart.
*   **Decision Points:** Decides when the generated PNG diagram accurately represents the process description.

##### robust_diagramer_agent
*   **Core Function:** Ensures high-quality and validated flowchart generation.
*   **Sub-agents:**
    *   **diagramer_agent:** Generates the flowchart image (PNG) based on the Markdown input.
    *   **ProcessValidatorChecker (Loop agent):** Validates the generated PNG chart against the input Markdown description, ensuring the visual representation accurately matches the textual process. It can request revisions from the `diagramer_agent` until validation criteria are met.

#### wrapper_agent
*   **Core Function:** Integrates the textual and visual outputs into a single, cohesive document.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Receives the Markdown workflow description from the `process_documentation_architect`.
    *   Receives the PNG flowchart image from the `diagramer_agent`.
    *   Creates a final document that merges both the Markdown description and the PNG image (e.g., embedding the image within the Markdown or a composite PDF/HTML).
*   **Decision Points:** None, its task is purely transformational.

#### posting_agent
*   **Core Function:** Handles the publication of the final approved document to a specified GitHub repository.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Receives the final approved document and the target GitHub directory from the `interactive_process_creator_agent`.
    *   Uses the `github MCP tool` to post the document to the designated repository.
*   **Decision Points:** None, its task is purely executive once approval and location are provided.

### Essential Tools and Resources
*   **`google_search` tool:** Used by `process_documentation_architect` and `diagramer_agent` for research, standard definitions, and best practices.
*   **`github MCP tool`:** Utilized by the `posting_agent` for publishing the final document to a GitHub repository.
*   **Markdown Format:** Standard output format for textual documentation.
*   **PNG Image Format:** Standard output format for workflow diagrams.

## Workflow

1.  **Request Initiation (User to interactive_process_creator_agent):**
    *   A user submits a request to the `interactive_process_creator_agent` with a short description of the desired workflow diagram, including its structure and goals.

2.  **Documentation Generation (interactive_process_creator_agent to process_documentation_architect):**
    *   The `interactive_process_creator_agent` delegates the task of creating the textual documentation to the `process_documentation_architect`.
    *   The `process_documentation_architect` uses `google_search` for context and employs its `robust_writing_agent` (which includes `process_writing_agent` and `ProcessValidatorChecker`) to generate a validated Markdown file describing the workflow.

3.  **Diagram Creation (interactive_process_creator_agent to diagramer_agent):**
    *   Once the Markdown is ready, the `interactive_process_creator_agent` delegates to the `diagramer_agent`.
    *   The `diagramer_agent` receives the Markdown, uses `google_search` for diagramming insights, and utilizes its `robust_diagramer_agent` (including `diagramer_agent` and `ProcessValidatorChecker`) to produce a validated PNG flowchart image corresponding to the Markdown description.

4.  **Document Integration (interactive_process_creator_agent to wrapper_agent):**
    *   The `interactive_process_creator_agent` sends both the generated Markdown and the PNG image to the `wrapper_agent`.
    *   The `wrapper_agent` merges these two components into a single, comprehensive document.

5.  **User Review and Approval (interactive_process_creator_agent to User):**
    *   The `interactive_process_creator_agent` presents the final integrated document to the user for review and feedback.
    *   Upon user approval, the `interactive_process_creator_agent` prompts the user for the specific GitHub directory where the document should be posted.

6.  **Publication (interactive_process_creator_agent to posting_agent):**
    *   With user approval and the GitHub directory provided, the `interactive_process_creator_agent` delegates the final step to the `posting_agent`.
    *   The `posting_agent` uses the `github MCP tool` to publish the document to the specified GitHub repository.
